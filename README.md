# ootp
Library for automating usage of OOTP's Simulation Module and generating data

This was last tested on OOTP XX and has not been tested on OOTP21. This library will not work on Linux as PyAutoGUI and the OOTP client do not play well there. This has not been tested on MacOS.

The CSV files were generated by the simtest.py script. A video of the script in operation can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lofo1RQcCoE&feature=youtu.be
